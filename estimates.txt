Recover Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum time your platform or service can be unavailable.
Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 1 minute
The failover in the multi AZ will happen in 1 minute once the failure in the one AZ is detected by monitor which checks the server health every minute.That's why the minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is 1 minute.

Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 1 hr
The failover in the multi Region will happen in 1 hr because of the following.
	- Failure in each AZ
	- Time taken by the support to acknowledge the alert
	- Booting up his machine and log into console
	- Promote the read replica to instance
	- Make the application connect to the standby database.

The RPO is a measure of how much data is lost during an incident. 
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 1 minute
Time taken by the monitor to detect the issue in the AZ server. So the data sent during this period is lost

Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 2 minutes
Time taken by the monitor to detect the issue in the AZ server.  So the data sent during this period is lost and application shows the maintenance page until the database is back online.
